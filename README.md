# LockettePro

All versions can be found on the
[Github Release Page](https://github.com/mergu/LockettePro/releases).

LockettePro is a block-protection plugin based on Lockette (https://github.com/Acru/Lockette),
the code base is entirely re-written. It is 100% compatable with original Lockette,
and the plugin behaviors are also 100% same.

This repo is a maintained fork of NyaaCat's LockettePro (https://github.com/NyaaCat/LockettePro).
